# Timber Man Variation

Timber Man is a game where you play as a Lumber Jack quickly chopping away at a tree. 
You are able to chop a piece of a huge tree trunk by either pressing the 
Right or Left buttons. At each chop ,the tree trunk gets cut, bringing down
branches with it. 

### The Task:

To cut as many pieces of the trunk without colliding with branches. You must
do so within a maximum 250ms time interval within each button press (chop). Failure to 
do so will result in a stop clock timer being decremented. The stopclock starts at 10
but if it decrements to 0, the game is ended. If Timber Man collides with a branch, he dies.   

Try to get a chopping high score! Good Luck!
